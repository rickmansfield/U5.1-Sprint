# Unit 5.1 Task 5 

## csCheckPalindrome Summary

- Note.. I originally empolyed builtins from taks1 and had to srcap them for that problem..>BUT they worked great here... 
  ```python
  # import builtins
print(dir(builtins))
print(dir(reversed))
print(help(reversed))
print(help(next))
- Initiate a variable to hold the reversed() and join() version of the submitted variable. 
- create simple conditional to compare original to reversed orders and return True/False respectively
